# Query Transformations: HyDE's Siblings (Phase 5 preview)

**TL;DR:** HyDE is one member of a family called **query transformations** —
techniques that rewrite the query *before* search. All of them live at the
same seam in `retriever.py`, and all of them get validated by the same eval.

## The family

All three live at the same "rewrite the query before search" stage:

```rawhtml
<div class="diagram">
  <div class="branch">
    <div class="flow"><span class="node data">question</span><span class="arw"></span><span class="node">transform</span></div>
    <span class="split-arw"></span>
    <div class="fork" style="flex-direction:column; gap:8px">
      <span class="node soft"><b>Multi-Query</b> — N rephrasings → N searches → RRF fuse</span>
      <span class="node soft"><b>Decomposition</b> — sub-questions → search each → combine</span>
      <span class="node soft"><b>HyDE</b> — fake answer → one search</span>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="flow-foot">All converge into the <b>same dense / BM25 / rerank machinery</b> after this point.</div>
</div>
```

**Multi-Query.** Rephrase the question N ways, search with all of them, fuse
the result lists with RRF — the *same* fusion already built in Phase 3
([`fusion.py`](../../docsmind/retrieval/fusion.py)). Attacks phrasing luck:
any single phrasing might miss; five phrasings rarely all miss.

**Decomposition.** Split a multi-hop question into sub-questions, retrieve per
sub-question. "How does a neutron star differ from a black hole?" becomes one
search about neutron stars and one about black holes — because no single chunk
answers the comparison, but two chunks together do.

**HyDE.** Transform the question into answer-shaped text
(see [problem-and-fix.md](problem-and-fix.md)).

## Same seam, different failure modes

| Technique | Extra LLM calls | Extra searches | Fails when |
|---|---|---|---|
| Multi-Query | 1 (generates N rephrasings) | N | Rephrasings are all synonyms of the same miss |
| Decomposition | 1 (splits the question) | one per sub-question | The split loses the connective logic of the question |
| HyDE | 1 (writes fake answer) | 1 | The fake answer is off-topic — retrieval steered wrong |

The shared cost: every one of them puts an LLM call in front of retrieval.
The shared payoff: they help most on exactly the queries plain dense search
fumbles — vague, multi-part, or vocabulary-poor questions.

## Why these belong to Phase 5, not Phase 3

Phase 3 (hybrid) improved *how* we search with a fixed query. Query
transformations change *what* we search with — and choosing when to apply
which rewrite is a decision. A static pipeline can't decide; an agent can.
That's the whole reason `docsmind/agent/` exists on the roadmap: a loop that
can look at a question and pick "plain search," "HyDE," or "decompose first."

When Phase 5 lands, each of these gets the full treatment: insertion point,
eval numbers, and the honest "did it beat hybrid?" verdict — same discipline
as [09-hybrid-retrieval/eval-results.md](../09-hybrid-retrieval/eval-results.md).

Tool selection and agent control loops continue in the separate Agentic AI
Prep website.
